# Phonebook

`phonebook` project from `https://fullstackopen.com/`

Deployed at https://phonebook-staeff.surge.sh/

## Development

The app reads json data from a development json server.
It needs to be started with the command `npm run servjson`

## Functionality

[x] Make form submission add name to the backend.
[x] create a service module for backend communication
[x] Make it possible to delete entries, use window.confirm for a confirmation screen
* Update a number, if the entry already exist, ask the user, they wish to do so.

## Loose Ends

* How to deploy this - a switch should discriminate between local and online running. Serve the development data online?
  Maybe this is no relevant, because the solution is to have a real backend.
